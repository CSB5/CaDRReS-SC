# CaDRReS-Sc
---

CaDRReS-Sc is a new implementation of [**Ca**ncer **D**rug **R**esponse prediction using a **Re**commender **S**ystem (**CaDRReS**)](https://github.com/CSB5/CaDRReS). This version will support drug response prediction for single-cell data. Also, CaDRReS-SC is now based on *TensorFlow v1.14*, allowing users to select optimizer, alternative objective functions, and reduce model training time.

We are preparing a manuscript for this new version. For the concept, please check our CaDRReS paper.
