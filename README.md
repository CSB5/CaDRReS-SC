# CaDRReS-Sc
---

CaDRReS-Sc is a new implementation of [**Ca**ncer **D**rug **R**esponse prediction using a **Re**commender **S**ystem (**CaDRReS**)](https://github.com/CSB5/CaDRReS). This version support moto- and combinatorial therapy response prediction based on single-cell RNA-Seq data. The predictive performance is notably improved from the first version, especially for unseen samples. Also, CaDRReS-Sc is now based on *TensorFlow v1.14*, allowing users to select optimizer, alternative objective functions, and reduce model training time. Example usages can be found in [notebook](https://github.com/CSB5/CaDRReS-Sc/tree/master/notebook).

We are preparing a manuscript for this new version. For the basic concept, please check our CaDRReS paper.
